### Project Overview
Played the role of a Junior Data Scientist for a music streaming service that's been losing more customers than usual in the past few months. Data science was used to figure out how to reduce customer churn. Prepared it for modeling in the future for supervised learning

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebook 

### Packages
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn

### Key Objectives
- Scoped the data science project
- Gathered the data in Python
- Cleaned the data
- Explored and visualized the data
- Prepared the data for modeling

### Findings
- A discount is correlated with a cancellation
- The more listening sessions, the fewer cancellations
- The more pop music, the more cancellations
- Podcast listening history seems unrelated to cancellations
